# Financial Performance Utilities

C++ utilities for parsing financial data and optimizing backend performance. Inspired by real-world systems at DXC Technology and CVS Health.

## 📖 Overview

This repository contains performance-critical C++ modules designed to handle large-scale financial and healthcare datasets. The utilities demonstrate efficient transaction parsing, optimized metric computations, and benchmarking techniques that highlight measurable improvements in throughput and computation speed.

## ⚙️ Features

- **High-Performance Transaction Parser:** Efficiently parses and validates large volumes of financial records.
- **Metrics Optimizer:** Optimized algorithms for real-time health and financial metrics.
- **Benchmarks:** Compare baseline vs optimized performance to demonstrate measurable gains.
- **Testing Suite:** Unit tests using GoogleTest to ensure reliability and maintainability.

## 🧪 Tech Stack

- C++17
- STL (Standard Template Library)
- CMake for build configuration
- GoogleTest for unit testing
